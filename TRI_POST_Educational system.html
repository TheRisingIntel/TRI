          <p>I have always believed that the education system of Africa using my country as a case study is a similitude of a round peg in a square hole. The education system my generation was exposed to is that which tells the student what to think and not how to think. It was the strictly built for students to write exams and not to reflect on the teachings and connect with real life scenarios. We learnt a lot in science, but the practicability of the knowledges gained from all those subjects remain obscured to students. We have great teachers, but they fail to build great students. Why do you think only 5 of 70 students in a class excel and could picture the classroom teaching to a real-life scenario? My finding so far is that those five had some other hidden forces aside the classroom teachings behind them assisting their comprehension and giving them the right assess to what they want. 
          </p>

          <p>As a high school teacher of Mathematics for up to five years in different high schools in Nigeria, I see a new category of students from the one of my generation. Now students are more inclined with how they can make money with their skills, giving less consideration to what school could offer them. A larger percentage are in school because their parents want them to be educated. I remember asking some of my students why they are in school. You will laugh at the response they give I want to be like my dad, I want to make money, I want to do this and that. A whole lot of them fail to present the real earning that education could provide. Now it is odd students versus the good teachers, It is a time when longer time are spent in the school and yet students will wait for assistance in the examination hall. 
          </p>
          
          <p>Covid effect on the education system has totally change a whole lot of things. My prediction about the future especially with the current trend of education system which is obviously moving toward being totally technologically inclined. Teachers upgrading themselves and students willing to learn practicability. If my prediction is right, Nigeria, I mean Africa at large would produce the next set of Einstein, Newton, Plato, Aristotle and a whole lot of others like them (the free thinkers and the innovators).  
          </p>

          
          <h3> Why Do Students Drop Out?</h3> 
          <p>A lot of factors contribute to why students leave school before graduating. Different research works have shown diverse reasons for which students in schools would leave the school without earning their certificate. 
          </p>
          <p>Early research focused on the characteristics of individual students who dropped out of school, including a number of demographic and social factors such as socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, gender, and disability status, age and few other factors. 
          </p>

          <p>In order to fully understand the concept of dropping out, two groups of researchers Jordan et al., 1994; Watt & Roessingh, 1994 identified a framework to explain the causes of students dropout which was tagged, pushed, pulled and fall out of school.
          </p>
          <p> The pushed factors were said to include situations within the school environment which led to consequences and eventual drop out such as grades, attendance, discipline policy, and even consequences of poor behaviour. The pulling factor on the other hand is identified to be situations within the student which include but not limited to financial worries, family needs, out of school employment, family changes such as marriages or childbirth. The falling out factor occurs when students show no significant improvement in academic work and become disenchanted over completion of school. 
          </p>

          <p>Considering the three factors stated above, one could easily understand the category which a student who drops out falls into. However, it should be noted that dropping out is a process and should not be considered as a single event. Once the category the student falls in is identified then such student could be easily assisted. </p>
 
          <h3>Do We Have Qualified Teachers?</h3>
          <p>The question do we have quality teachers struck my mind with sadness. I can say this with my whole chest that we do have qualified teachers, but a whole lot of factors contribute to their poor deliverance
          </p>
          <p>Imagine a single teacher in high school teaching over 200 students from different arms about four to five subjects. Firstly, the subject matter always varies in these subjects. Let’s consider the case of a single teacher taking Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and Further-Mathematics in fact, the efficiency of the teacher as such cannot be relied on. The case is not different with different government owned schools, the number of students to a single teacher is nothing to write home about even though the Nigerian National Policy on Education specify that for effective teaching and learning, the teacher-students ratio shall be 1:35. </p>

          <p> Another angle is the Majority of teachers especially in private high schools take up the job because they could not get a job in line with their academic background. Hence, they result to teaching. To me I believe this is cheating. One thing that should be put into consideration as a teacher is that <b> “you will be in charge of some lives”.</b>  
          </p>
          

          <p>If salaries were to be the reason why people engaged in teaching, most schools would have stopped running for a long time now. One of the most highly underpaid professionals in Nigeria are the teachers. Even though they are the nation builders, they receive less salary compared to the work they offer.</p>
          
          <p>We as students recognize excellent teachers when we cross path with them. So, I reiterate that we do have <b> qualified teacher.</b> With this I am going to stop with a quote from one of the best tutor I know David Berliner who said that <b>“Children and young people live nested lives, so that when classrooms do not function as we want them to, we go to work on improving them. Those classrooms are in schools, so when we decide that those schools are not performing appropriately, we go to work on improving them as well. But those young people are situated in families, in neighbourhoods, in peer groups who shape attitude and aspirations often more powerfully than their parents or teachers”.</b> </p>
