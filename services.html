                                    <p>Low employee engagement is a costly problem! It costs businesses <a href="https://www.shrm.org/about-shrm/press-room/press-releases/pages/human-capital-benchmarking-report.aspx" target="blank">$4,129 on average to hire new talent</a>, <a href="https://trainingmag.com/sites/default/files/trn-2018-industry-report.pdf" target="blank"> and around $986 to onboard the new hire</a>. That means you lose over $5,000 each time an employee walks out the door, not to mention the unquantifiable cost of losing an experienced employee!</p>

                    <p>Proactively envisioned knowledge-based expertise and cross-cultural growth strategies. Seamlessly actualizing quality intellectual capital with no prejudice for diversity and inclusiveness. None of us (humans) is as intelligent as ALL OF US. Our <b>Intelligence</b> is <b>Collective (e.g., cultural evolution, and technological evolution as a result of cummulative human knowledge).</b></p>
                    <p>A revolunary leader must not only be rigid or have absolute predictable patterns. A visionary leader must be dynamic, participative, collaborative, etc, while as well having commendable knowledge of every aspect of his/her organization. All these skills together  may not possibly be in a manager, and can even be of greater burden (with impending danger of work-inflicted trauma). Such a leader must be ready and able to delegate managerial roles. Yet, to ensure competent employees that can be delegated with leading roles in addition to their pretrained obligation, he/she must first explore the collective intelligence potentials of such organization. To not fall within the traps of collective stupidity, this requires careful considerations and processes. Let us assist your organization with ideas and processes that bridge gaps between  the common people and the decision makers and to create new paradigms of leadership within your private and governmental organizations.</p>
