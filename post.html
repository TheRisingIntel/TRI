          <p>Few days ago, an honorable state leader and professor visited my school (UM6P), he was happy to have met us. Just like people usually do, out of curiosity or rather a test of our understanding of what we study, he asked me: "What is Collective intelligence?". This question does not present anyone asking as an ignorant or unexposed. It may only mean that they are yet to be informed or perhaps, want to know even more! Whichever it is, we value people's curiosity to recognizing the value of this emerging science.</p>

          <p>So, what is Collective Intelligence? According to UM6P's School of Collective Intelligence, <span class="definition"> "Collective Intelligence is the ability of groups to outperform individuals in learning, decision-making, problem-solving, prediction, and other cognitive skills". "It is the scientific field studying the conditions of this phenomenon within teams, organizations, and societies". </span>  </p>
          
          
          <h3>The meeting point between AI and CI?</h3>
          <p>As concise as the above definitions are, some minds still get boggled and misinterprete Collective Intelligence as the same as Artificial Intelligence. This is why some laymen would say, "..but computer can do it!". Although, there is the meeting point between AI and CI, AI was made out of the people's CI. CI is deeper, and wider. Artificial Intelligence is the branch of computer science which deals with the reproduction or mimicking (artificial) of human-level intelligence,  conscience, self-awareness, and knowledge ,and thought in computer program (software package). Collective Intelligence on the other is "human-shared intelligence" (inborn/learnt, and can be changed at will), born out of man-to-man collaborations/interactions, competition (constructive), and as a result of aligned interest (problem-solving), deliberation, diversity, tolerance, and consensual agreement, etc. The meeting point is where there is the interactions of people and computers to augment collective intelligence. Having this augmentation will bring great opportunities to businesses in real ways.</p>

          
          <h3> Are you wondering why it matters to study this emerging science holistically?</h3> 
          <p>Let me highlight just a few reasons here:
          In a book edited by Mark Tovey, "COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace", Robert Steele wrote (in the preface); <span class="definition"> "...I want all of us to come together to give our children, and the next seven generations, the gift of a prosperous world at peace. All of our institutions are broken—it is now up to us as a <u> collective</u>."</span> </p>
          <p><span class="definition">"...Such a revolution in the group mind of the human collective is the only means by which we can create infinite stabilizing wealth that enables the assurance of a good life for all. Corruption, crime, and corporate misbehavior can be reduced through the non-violent acquisition and sharing of legal, ethical,open information that is discriminated, distilled, and disseminated on a “just enough, just in time, just right basis.”</span></p>

          <p>According to <a href="https://www.clearpeople.com/blog/what-is-collective-intelligence-workplace" target="blank">ClearPeople,</a> <span class="definition"> "The most important intelligence in the foreseeable is <em>not Artificial Intelligence </em> but, rather, a <em>Collective Intelligence </em> that includes both people and computers. And this is where there is a major opportunity currently untapped by many organisations".</span></p> Everyday, our world becomes more complex; we have no certainty of what tomorrow holds, just like we had no idea until covid-19 pandemic. Our survival depends on how collective we can become. In this complex world, tackling problems require making decisions which have multiple unknown outcomes. By using collective intelligence, we have the needed data aggregation skills, human understanding, technology and diverse human skills to tackle each version of these uncertainties.</p>

          <p><span class="definition"> To put collective intelligence in the right contexts, four important markers have been identified: </span> <br>
          1. Knowledge Management: This include knowledge aggregation (Data collection), Data conversion, Prediction, Project/Group Management, Heterogeneous search and referral (wisdom of crowds), etc. <br>
          2. Collaborative Work: This include understanding of various personalities (Behavioural Management), Trainings (Academic and otherwise), etc. <br>
          3. Organizational Knowledge: This include being a sensemaker of aggregate and particular data, knowledge of Trade secrets, E-commerce knowledge, etc. <br>
          4. External Information: This means you having some useful information regarding Environmental Monitoring (e.g., for climate change mitigation), Technology Monitoring (e.g., evolving collaborative tools), Customer Monitoring (business management), Government Monitoring (leadership and policies), Local Knowledge (e.g., community engagement knowledge), etc.
          </p>
          <p>From the above stated markers, I hope you will agree with me that a collective intelligence specialist is supposedly a psychologist, data scientist, computer scientist, business manager, participative leader, collaborative learner, watchful citizen, etc. All these in just one person; Are we not amazing! <span style='font-size:15px;'>&#128522;</span> </p>

          <h3>Who may study collective intelligence?</h3> <p>The answer to this is very simple: <span class="definition">if collective intelligence is only meant for people with some certain academic backgrounds, then it is not <b>intelligence collective.</b> Hence, it is a multidisciplinary field of study which is totally inclusive and relevant to every field of studies and geographical regions. </span> Nevertheless, there are some attributes that a prospective student of collective intelligence must possess. Given its multidisciplinarism, it is wider, deeper, and more technical than any single field of study. A prospective CI specialist would have to be tenacious (multitask), openminded (to sharing and peering), visionary change maker (alacrity for change), deliberative (constructive dialogues), explorative, etc. It may get rigorous at some point,there may come a time when you would feel overwhelmed a bit. But with a clearly set goal, you will always find the strength to keep going. I assure you, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. In other words, as long as you are averagely daring, then, you are a good fit for collective intelligence.
          </p>

          <h3>Where can you study collective intelligence? </h3> <p> Although collective intelligence is an ever-existing phenomenon, there were no significance attentions to studying it as a science until very recently. The School of Collective Intelligence, Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco is the first of its kind across the world, wherein collective intelligence is being studied and researched in its holistic forms. The school is new but gracefully endowed with adequate study resources and professors. If you would try studying here, then you would have begun your journey to impactful greatness! </p>

              A very good write-up and topic. Now, I know what Collective intelligence is. I hope to also study it.
