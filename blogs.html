          <p>Everyone needs it.. Everyone uses it.. Without it, there may be no survival. Yet, its pure form is rare and unstable. If wrongly handled, it can be distructive (collective stupidity); a double edged sword! Fortunately, We are studying and using it the right way at the <a href="sci.um6p.ma">UM6P's School of Collective Intelligence</a>, so that the world can have the desired transformative changes and sustainability.</p>

          <p>African is a continent in no way devoid of intellectual resources. In fact, our intellectual prowess is being recognized and commended by other nations. This is why you would see an African born farmer, doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc. migrating to these countries with ease and ready admittance. What could we do to make these endowed resources work for Africa, first before any other? At what level can we start these collaboration (highschool, university, or right within our various organizations?) What tools would we need to make this a reality? What connections (resourceful people) do we already have in Africa that can spearhead these tasks?</p>

          <p>This post will dive deeply into this the impending dangers of climate change in Africa. Restorative adaptation is too costly for Africa. We need to focus on the anticipatory adaptation. But how? With who?, etc.  What should industies do? What can the governments do differently? What can we do collectively?</p>
